This machine learning project is centered on the crucial task of detecting bad credit customers for credit card approval. The project's core focus lies in developing a robust predictive model that can effectively assess the creditworthiness of applicants. By successfully identifying potential high-risk customers, the model aims to enhance the credit approval process, minimize financial risks, and contribute to more informed decision-making in the realm of credit card applications.

These are some valuable business advantages that are offered by the result of this project:

* **Enhanced Risk Management**: Accurate identification of high-risk customers minimizes the potential for financial losses and defaults.
* **Improved Approval Process**: Streamlined credit assessment leads to quicker and more precise credit decisions, enhancing customer satisfaction.
* **Reduced Manual Workload**: Automated detection of bad credit customers reduces the need for manual review and speeds up the approval process.
* **Enhanced Customer Relationships**: Identifying and declining bad credit customers prevents overextension of credit and fosters trust among good credit customers.
* **Financial Stability**: Minimizing exposure to bad credit risks contributes to the overall financial health and stability of the lending institution.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Accurate risk assessment ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and prevents unauthorized lending.
* **Optimal Resource Allocation**: Precise identification of bad credit customers allows for targeted collection efforts and resource allocation.
* **Competitive Advantage**: Effective risk management sets the organization apart from competitors and builds a reputation for responsible lending practices.
* **Improved Profitability**: Reduced bad debt and increased repayment rates lead to improved financial outcomes and higher profitability.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: The analysis of credit data provides valuable insights into customer behavior, aiding in refining credit policies and strategies.

**In short**: save the business more time, save the business more money, provide the business more insight, and make the business more money.

#### Now let's jump into the coding process!

## **Data Pre-processing**
### Impot used libraries
```{r message=FALSE}
library(Ardian)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(inspectdf)
library(partykit)
library(e1071)
```

### Read the dataset
```{r}
risk <- read.csv("credit_card_approval.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

### Inspect the data {.tabset}
#### Top 6 rows
```{r}
risk %>% head()
```

#### Bottom 6 rows
```{r}
risk %>% tail()
```

### Check duplicated rows
```{r}
risk %>% duplicated() %>% any()
```
> Alhamdulillah there are no duplicated rows

### Check missing values
```{r}
risk %>% anyNA()
```
> Alhamdulillah there are no missing values

### Check data structure
```{r}
risk %>% glimpse()
```
> Some categorical columns are count as numerical, including the target variable. We'll handle that

### Parse categorical columns
I'm also gonna change the name of the target column to `bad_credit`
```{r}
risk <- risk %>%
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("FLAG"), TARGET), as.factor) %>%
  rename(bad_credit = TARGET)

risk %>% glimpse()
```

### Remove unneeded columns
The *ID* column is just the record identifier that shouldn't be used for modelling so  gonna remove it
```{r}
risk <- risk %>% select(-ID)

risk %>% glimpse()
```
> Cool! Now we're ready to explore the target variable and the features

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**
### Check target variable proportion
```{r}
risk$bad_credit %>% table() %>% barplot()
```

> Nuh uh. It's imbalanced! I will upsample the data!

### Upsampling
```{r}
up_risk <- upSample(x = risk%>% select(-bad_credit),
                     y = risk$bad_credit,
                     yname = "bad_credit")

up_risk$bad_credit %>% table() %>% barplot()
```

> Cool! It's balanced now!

### Inspect categorical columns distributions
```{r message=FALSE}
up_risk %>% inspect_cat() %>% show_plot()
```

> FLAG_MOBIL column is all 1, I'm gonna remove it because it's useless, it won't provide any information for the model

### Remove uninformative categorical columns
```{r message=FALSE}
risk <- risk %>% select(-nearZeroVar(.))

risk %>% inspect_cat() %>% show_plot()
```

> Cool! We're now left with informative categorical columns. Now, let's explore the numerical columns!

```{r}
plotCatTargetbyCatCols <- function(data, target, position = "stack", flip = F) {
  data <- data %>% select_if(is.factor)
  
  target_col <- as.character(substitute(target))
  
  for (col in colnames(data %>% select(-(!!sym(target_col))))) {
    
    colors <- c("#014C72", "skyblue", "#1572A1", "#6C9BCF", "#1E87C7", "#B0578D", "#FACBEA", "#FFE4D6", "#BA704F", "#D2E0FB",  "#435334", "#00854D", "#46DF9C", "#B9EDDD", "#B0A4A4", "#99A8B2", "#8294C4", "#9384D1", "#1C0347")
    max_unique <- max(sapply(data, function(col) length(unique(col))))
    
    if (!flip){
      table_df <- as.data.frame(table(data[[col]], data[[target_col]]))
      colnames(table_df) <- c(col, target_col, "Count")
      
      gg <- ggplot(table_df, aes(y = Count, x = !!sym(target_col), fill = !!sym(col))) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position) +
        labs(y = "Count", x = target_col, fill = col) +
        theme_minimal() +
        scale_fill_manual(values = rep_len(colors, max_unique)) +
        ggtitle(paste(target_col, "by", col))
    }
    else{
      table_df <- as.data.frame(table(data[[target_col]], data[[col]]))
      colnames(table_df) <- c(target_col, col, "Count")
      
      gg <- ggplot(table_df, aes(x = Count, y = !!sym(col), fill = !!sym(target_col))) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position) +
        labs(x = "Count", y = col, fill = target_col) +
        theme_minimal() +
        scale_fill_manual(values = rep_len(colors, max_unique)) +
        ggtitle(paste(target_col, "by", col))
    }
    
    print(gg)
  }
}

plotCatTargetbyCatCols(up_risk, bad_credit, "stack", flip = F)
```

### Inspect numerical columns distributions
```{r message=FALSE}
for (col in up_risk %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% colnames()) {
  print(
    ggplot(up_risk, aes(x = !!sym(col))) +
    geom_histogram(aes(fill = after_stat(density)), col = "white", show.legend = F) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = "Density",
         title = paste(col)) +
    theme_minimal()
  )
}
```

> Alhamdulillah, all numerical columns are distributed normally. We can now move onto cross validation!

## **Cross Validation**
### Set training indices
```{r}
set.seed(1)

indices <- createDataPartition(y = up_risk$bad_credit,
                               p = 0.8,
                               list = F)
```

### Split train & test
```{r}
train_data <- up_risk[indices, ]
test_data <- up_risk[-indices, ]

X_train <- train_data %>% select(-bad_credit)
y_train <- train_data$bad_credit

X_test <- test_data %>% select(-bad_credit)
y_test <- test_data$bad_credit
```

## **Model Fitting, Evaluation, and Selection**
### Naive Bayes Algorithm
Because I have large data, I will start with Naive Bayes algorithm because it's fast like my Bugatti Chiron🏎️⚡
```{r}
model_nb <- naiveBayes(x = X_train,
                       y = y_train,
                       laplace = 1)
```

### Naive Bayes Model Evaluation
```{r}
pred_nb <- predict(model_nb, X_test)

confusionMatrix(pred_nb, y_test, positive = "1")
```
> The Naive Bayes model exhibited outstanding `99% Accuracy`, `100% Sensitivity`, and `99% Specificity` in predicting bad credit customers. This is an amazing performace. We don't necessary need further model fitting, but I'm gonna try using Decision Tree Classifier algorithm because I believe I could get to 100% Accuracy!

### Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm
```{r}
tree <- ctree_control(mincriterion = 0.9,
                      minsplit = 5,
                      minbucket = 3)

model_dt <- ctree(formula = bad_credit ~ .,
                  data = train_data,
                  control = tree)
```

### Decision Tree Model Evaluation
```{r}
pred_dt <- predict(model_dt, X_test)

confusionMatrix(pred_dt, y_test, positive = "1")
```
> I was right! `100% Accuracy!`
>
> The decision tree model achieved perfect Accuracy in detecting bad credit customers, making it the winner model of this project! Congratulations to `model_dt`!🥳🤩

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the final model has exhibited outstanding performance in predicting bad credit customers. With a perfect Accuracy of 100%, the model demonstrated exceptional precision in classifying both bad and not bad credit cases. The Sensitivity value of 100% further reinforces the model's efficacy in identifying all instances of bad credit customers, making it an ideal choice for capturing such cases. Moreover, the model's Specificity of 100% indicates its ability to accurately identify non-bad credit customers. In brief, the decision tree model's outstanding accuracy of 100% renders it suitable for real-world applications!
